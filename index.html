        <h1>The only man burried on the Moon</h1>
        <p> <br>
          Eugene Merle Shoemaker was an American geologist who played a key role in training the Apollo astronauts to explore the Moon in a scientific manner. 
          Unfortunately, his greatest dream to walk on the Moon eluded him, since he was not an astronaut due to minor medical issue. In 1999, his ashes were carried to the Moon.
        </p>
        <p>To this day he remains the only person whose ashes were burried on the Moon.

        <h1> Message in a bottle </h1>
        <p> <br> 
          A message in a bottle is a form of communication often used to send distress messages, memorial tributes or deceased loved ones' ashes on a final journey.
          Through the history, its nature was most often romantic.Though most messages are never discovered, the few that are found make for an interesting story.

        <p>
          In 1995, 10-year-old Josh Baker wrote a note that said, <i>My name is Josh Baker. I'm 10. If you find this, put it on the news. The date is 4/16/95.</i> Josh died in a car accident in 2005, and the note was found in 2006 and delivered to his family.

        <h1> Why are the eyes so interesting? </h1>
        <p> <br>
        <p> Speaking of eyes, symbolic meanings vary greatly. There is a list of interesting articles and essays on topics such as <i>Eye symbolism </i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eyes are very interesting to us humans, not only because they see, but they also provide others with a glimpse into our thoughts. 
          Also, vision is majorly a process of the brain which allows us to see visual cues from another individual's eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bonus interesting fact : Eye is the only organ which doesn't grow.

        <h1>  Symbolism and aestheticism of rings  </h1>
        <p> <br>
        <p>A ring is a neverending circle,a symbol of eternity. The wedding ring, known as the symbol of the pledge of love, serves to signify the neverending love between the couple.</p>
        <p>
          They are mostly made of metal, but can be made from different materials. Trying to sort them by their styles requires a great deal of time. The list of the styles includes
          wedding ring, mood ring, engagement ring, coctail ring, class ring and championship ring. Rings worn simply for beauty became established in the eighteenth century.
          Today, stacking rings is a fashion statement.
